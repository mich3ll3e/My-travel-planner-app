As a tourist, I want to be able to conveniently plan the details of my trip. I would like to ensure that the weather at my destination is ideal for the adventures I wish to go on. I also would like to find flights that fit my timeline and budget. Additionally, I would like to have a list of all the activities I can choose to do at my destination, and an idea of how much each costs. With My Travel Planner, I can do all of that!

## Step 1
Enter current location and destination, as well as the start and end date of the trip.

## Step 2
